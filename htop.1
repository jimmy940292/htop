.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
This program is a free (GPL) ncurses-based process viewer. 
.LP
It is similar to top, but allows to scroll the list vertically and 
horizontally to see all processes and their full command lines.
.LP
Tasks related to processes (killing, renicing) can be done without
entering their PIDs.
.br 
.SH "INTERACTIVE COMMANDS"
.LP 
The following commands are supported:
.LP 
.TP 5
.B Space
"Tag": mark a process. Commands that can operate on multiple processes,
like "kill", will then apply over the list of tagged processes, instead
of the currently highlighted one.
.TP
.B F1, h
Help screen
.TP
.B F2
"Follow" process: if the sort order causes the currently selected process
to move in the list, make the selection bar follow it. This is useful for
monitoring a process: this way, you can keep a process always visible on
screen. When a movement key is used, "follow" loses effect.
.TP
.B F3, /
Incremental process search: type in part of a process command line and
the selection highlight will be moved to it.
.TP
.B F4
Invert sort order: if sort order is increasing, switch to decreasing,
and vice-versa.
.TP
.B F5
Select sorting by previous field. The sort field is indicated by a
highlight in the header.
.TP
.B F6
Select sorting by next field. The sort field is indicated by a
highlight in the header.
.TP
.B F7, ]
Increase selected process priority (superuser only)
.TP
.B F8, [
Decrease selected process priority
.TP
.B F9, k
"Kill" process: sends a signal which is selected in a menu, to one or a group
of processes. If processes were tagged, sends the signal to all tagged processes.
If none is tagged, sends to the currently selected process.
.TP
.B F10, q
Quit
.TP
.B M
Sort by memory usage (top compatibility key)
